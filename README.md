## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Google Fonts (Outfit)

### What I learned

Responsiveness and Flexbox: I gained more hands-on experience in creating responsive layouts. Using Flexbox allowed me to center elements and create a flexible, mobile-first design. I also learned how to handle different screen sizes effectively by adjusting widths and applying max-width for images.

Styling a simple design: Although the challenge was simple, I practiced creating a clean, minimalist design that doesn't overwhelm the user. I learned how to balance text, images, and spacing to create an aesthetically pleasing layout.

Working with images: I worked with images (QR code) and figured out how to make them responsive while maintaining the design's integrity across different screen sizes.

Mobile-first workflow: I practiced the concept of starting with a mobile layout and scaling up. This was a good reminder of the importance of prioritizing mobile design in todayâ€™s web development practices.

### Continued development

Improving accessibility: In the future, I plan to improve the accessibility of this component, like adding more alt text and considering color contrast for users with visual impairments.

Advanced CSS techniques: I want to explore using more advanced CSS techniques, such as CSS Grid, for future projects to have more control over layouts.

JavaScript functionality: If I expand this project, I could integrate JavaScript to allow users to generate their own QR codes or interact with the component in more dynamic ways.

### Useful resources

- [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) - I used Google Fonts to select the "Outfit" font, which gave the component a modern and clean look.
- [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/home) - This platform provided the challenge and is a great resource for improving coding skills through real-world projects.
